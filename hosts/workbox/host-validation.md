## This machine: workbox

workbox has eight vCPUs (t3.2xlarge) and 30 GiB of RAM, shared by interactive
coding tools, T3, and production previews.

- Limits: 6 jobs, 3 heavy, 2 builds. Vitest defaults to 5 workers.
- Each job runs in its own scope under `builds.slice`
  (`~/.config/systemd/user/builds.slice`), which the kernel enforces: CPU weight
  100, below `app.slice` at weight 1000 for T3 and production previews. T3 also
  has weight 1000 within `app.slice`; agent sessions use `agents.slice` at
  weight 100. Unused CPU remains available to lower-weight groups. Validation
  jobs use at most 800% CPU together. Build memory is reclaimed above 18G and
  hard-capped at 22G. If a build is OOM-killed (exit 137), rerun it once the
  host is quieter. These limits apply only to host-check jobs;
  `t3code.service` has `MemoryLow=2G`.
- Never start a development server (`next dev`, `vite`, `pnpm dev`, and the
  like), for any purpose. They compile on demand and burn CPU this host does not
  have. Build through the queue and serve production with `next start`, or
  restart the mapped `*-prod` service. The guard denies dev servers, including
  `a11y-pages.ts` without `A11Y_BASE_URL` and `smoke-local.ts`, which boot one.
  For nj-homes-choice-next page gates run
  `~/.local/bin/njhomes-page-gates [FILE...]`.
- `bg-job` runs each job as a transient systemd user service, `bgjob-NAME`.
