# Review loop

Run `code-review` and `pedro-best-practices` in rounds, fix what they confirm,
and re-review only the **delta**, until a round comes back clean. The user is
asked only for the decisions that are theirs. Code stays local until the push
step; the loop's results go on each PR as one generated comment.

`scripts/loop.py` owns everything reviewers and readers see: the reviewer
briefs, the findings check, the triage record, and the PR comment. Reviewers
follow `reviewer.md`. Set `SKILL_DIR` to this skill's absolute directory and
`LOOP` to the loop directory. Read before starting:
`~/.config/t3-orchestration.md` (dispatch),
`~/.config/host-validation.md` (checks, `bg-job`), and for a stack
`split-stacked-prs` section 7, which owns carrying fixes and pushing.

## Invocation

Take from the user's message, else from the ledger of an earlier run on the
same target, else ask once:

- **Target**: a PR, a stack (its top PR or branch), or a local branch with its base.
- **Reviewer** model and effort, and **worker** model and effort for fixes.
- **Push**: whether a converged loop pushes (default: stop locally and report).
- **Round cap**: default 5, the first full round included.

## The ledger

`LOOP` is `~/.cache/review-loop/<target-slug>/`. Reviewers read its ledger and
outcomes every round, so a lost session resumes from the files, not from
memory:

- `ledger.md`: the target, the invocation settings, standing decisions and
  user rulings, and one line per round.
- `outcomes.jsonl`: each finding's triage result, written only by
  `loop.py outcome`. A finding with an outcome is settled; reviewers never
  re-raise it.
- `rN/heads.tsv`: one line per PR, bottom to top,
  `PR<TAB>LAYER<TAB>BASE_SHA<TAB>HEAD_SHA` (layer = manifest name; for a single
  branch, one line). Use the PR number when the PR exists; the comment goes
  only to numbered PRs.
- `rN/reviewers.tsv` and `rN/<reviewer>.json`: written by `loop.py brief` and
  by the reviewers.

Update the ledger at the end of every step that changes it.

## Steps

### 1. Pin the round

Record `rN/heads.tsv` from the local branches. Round 1, or any PR new since the
last round, is reviewed whole. Later rounds compute the delta:

```bash
bash "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/delta.sh" --prev rN-1/heads.tsv --heads rN/heads.tsv \
  --out rN [--manifests "$plan/layers"] --repo "$checkout"
```

A PR with no delta is skipped this round. Done when every PR is marked whole,
delta, or skipped.

### 2. Dispatch reviewers

Write the round's facts to `rN/common.md`: the checkout path, the pinned
base and heads, the spec path, the repository's standards sources, the gates
already passed, operational constraints, and the principles from
`~/.config/principles.md` that match the diff. `reviewer.md` carries the rules,
methods, and output format; the packet holds only what is true of this run.

Pick the reviewers:

- **Whole** (round 1, or a PR new since the last round): one `standards` and
  one `spec` reviewer for the stack or branch, and one `audit` per PR.
- **Delta**: one `delta` reviewer for the PRs with a delta, and one
  `audit --delta` per PR whose delta has `audit=yes`.

For each, generate its task:

```bash
python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/loop.py" brief "$LOOP" N ROLE --model "MODEL EFFORT" \
  [--pr PR ...] [--delta] --checkout "$checkout"
```

Launch them all at once through `delegate_task`, `mode: "async"`, with the
reviewer model, `clientRequestId` `<slug>-rN-<reviewer name>`, and the brief's
output, verbatim, as the task. Done when every reviewer is launched and its
`taskId` is in `rN/tasks.tsv`. End the turn; completions wake you.

### 3. Triage

Run `python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/loop.py" check "$LOOP" N --checkout "$checkout"`.
It validates every reviewer's file and lists the round's findings. A reviewer
whose file fails goes back to its task with the check's output, through
`delegate_task` with a new `clientRequestId`.

Verify every finding against the code at its pinned SHA before it counts, and
classify it:

- **Fix**: a confirmed bug (any P1 or P2), or any confirmed P3 that needs no
  design or architecture decision. Its outcome is recorded once it is committed.
- **Decline**: unconfirmed, settled, pre-existing outside the change, or
  contradicted by a ruling: `loop.py outcome "$LOOP" ID declined --note REASON`.
- **Decision**: product behavior, copy, scope, or a design or architecture
  choice (including a P3 whose fix needs one):
  `loop.py outcome "$LOOP" ID decision --note RECOMMENDATION`. Keep going with
  the rest.

Done when `check` passes and every finding is a Fix or has an outcome.

### 4. Converge or fix

The round is **clean** when it has no Fix items. Clean, or at the round cap:
go to step 5. Otherwise:

1. Brief workers (worker model, `delegate_task`) to edit the fixed source:
   the stack's source branch, or the branch itself. Give each disjoint file
   ownership, its findings, and the ledger; workers run no checks.
2. Read each worker's diff as a reviewer would, then run the light check from
   `split-stacked-prs` section 7 step 4 (for a single branch, the same check
   on that branch).
3. Commit. For a stack, carry the fixes into their layers with
   `fix_layers.sh`. Record each fix with
   `loop.py outcome "$LOOP" ID fixed --commit SHA`, using the commit on the
   PR's own branch (for a stack, the layer commit). Then start the next round
   at step 1.

Post one short progress line to the user per round: round number, reviewers,
confirmed findings, and fixes made.

### 5. Finish

- **Open decisions**: ask them all in one `AskUserQuestion`, recommendation
  first. Record each ruling with `loop.py outcome "$LOOP" ID ruled --note RULING`.
  A ruling that changes code reopens the loop at step 4 with one more delta
  round, without counting against the cap.
- **Push** (when authorized, or when the user approves now): for a stack,
  follow `split-stacked-prs` section 7 step 5; for a branch, run its gates and
  push.
- **Comment**: run
  `python3 "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/loop.py" publish "$LOOP" --checkout "$checkout"`.
  It posts each PR's comment when GitHub's head is the head the last round
  reviewed, once per round, and says which PRs it skipped. A PR skipped for
  local fixes gets its comment by running `publish` again after an approved
  push. The comment covers the audits, so post no separate
  `pedro-best-practices` comment.
- **Report**: whether the loop converged or hit the cap, what is still open,
  each PR's comment URL or why it was skipped, local versus pushed heads, and
  the gate results. `loop.py render "$LOOP" PR --checkout "$checkout"` prints a
  PR's rounds and findings tables.

Merging and marking PRs ready stay with the user.
